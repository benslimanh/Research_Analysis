## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a quantitative analysis comparing the performance and risk profile of a **Sharia-Compliant ETF (SPUS)** versus the traditional **S&P 500 ETF (SPY)** over a 2-year period. The goal is to understand the financial implications of ethical/religious screening on portfolio volatility and returns.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `yfinance`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`
* **Environment:** Google Colab

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1. Performance (Returns)
* **The Islamic Fund (SPUS)** outperformed the traditional market benchmark.
* *Reasoning:* This is largely driven by the exclusion of financial institutions and heavy weighting in high-growth technology stocks (e.g., NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft).

### 2. Risk Analysis (Volatility)
* **Volatility:** SPUS demonstrated slightly **higher volatility** compared to SPY.
* **Why?** The exclusion of the banking sector (which typically acts as a stabilizer) creates a **"Sector Allocation Bias"** towards the Technology sector, which is inherently more volatile.

## 📉 Visualizations
*(Here you can add the charts generated from the notebook)*
